An Order Management System (OMS) is critical in handling the entire lifecycle 
of an order—from placement to delivery, and sometimes returns. When a customer 
places an order through an online store, the OMS is responsible for verifying 
inventory, processing the order, coordinating with the warehouse, and updating 
the customer. It acts as a bridge between e-commerce platforms, inventory databases, 
shipping providers, and customer service systems.

One of the main benefits of an OMS is its ability to enable real-time inventory 
visibility and order routing. For example, if a product is out of stock in one 
warehouse but available in another, the OMS can intelligently reroute the order 
to the right location for faster delivery. It also supports features like partial 
fulfillment, backorders, and split shipments—all of which enhance flexibility in 
how orders are fulfilled and customers are served.

Modern OMS platforms also integrate with logistics carriers, payment systems, 
and customer support tools, ensuring a seamless post-purchase experience. 
They provide tracking updates to customers, manage return requests, and help 
resolve fulfillment issues quickly. For businesses operating at scale or across 
multiple warehouses and storefronts, a robust OMS is essential to maintain operational 
efficiency and customer satisfaction.
