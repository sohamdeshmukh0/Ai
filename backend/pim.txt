A Product Information Management (PIM) system serves as a centralized hub for collecting,
managing, and enriching product data. In an e-commerce environment, where consistent and 
accurate product details are essential across multiple channels like websites, mobile apps,
marketplaces, and print catalogs, a PIM ensures that all product-related information stays
updated and synchronized. It allows teams to streamline product onboarding, 
improve time-to-market, and reduce manual errors.
